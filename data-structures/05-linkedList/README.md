## Challenge 05

- Create a Node Class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
    - Define a method called `insert` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
    - Define a method called `includes` which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node's value somewhere within the list.
    - Define a method called `toString` which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
        - `"{a}->{b}->{c}->{NULL}"`
- Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods your wrote for this lab.

## Approach & Efficiency

## API
- `insert()`:
    - fill
- `includes()`:
    - fill
- `toString()`:
    - fill
