## Challenge 17
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input.

---

## Approach & Efficiency
To accomplish this type of traversal , we are utilizing a queue to keep track of the nodes. This will add each node at each level throughout the tree. O(n) Time complexity, plus recursion I am not sure what that might be. O(1) space back and forth adding and removing to que, but in the end its empty.
